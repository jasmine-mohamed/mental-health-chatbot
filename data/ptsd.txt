Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as an accident, abuse, natural disaster, or violence.

Common symptoms of PTSD:

Re-experiencing symptoms:
Flashbacks or intrusive thoughts
Nightmares
Distress when reminded of the trauma
Avoidance symptoms:
Avoiding people, places, or situations that are reminders
Emotional numbness
Arousal and reactivity symptoms:
Feeling tense or on edge
Sleep problems
Angry outbursts or irritability
Mood and cognition symptoms:
Negative thoughts about oneself or the world
Guilt, shame, or self-blame
Loss of interest in once-enjoyed activities
How to manage PTSD:

Talk to a professional — therapies like EMDR or trauma-focused CBT are highly effective.
Practice grounding techniques — focus on your senses to stay connected to the present.
Join a support group — sharing with others can help you feel less alone.
Build a routine — consistency provides a sense of control and stability.
You are not defined by what happened to you. Healing is possible.
