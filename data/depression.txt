Depression is a common but serious mental health condition that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. It’s more than just sadness — it’s a deep, persistent sense of emotional pain, emptiness, or hopelessness.

💬 Common Symptoms of Depression:
Persistent sadness or emptiness
Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
Fatigue or low energy, even after rest
Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
Sleep problems (either sleeping too much or too little)
Changes in appetite or weight
Feeling worthless, guilty, or like a burden
Thoughts of self-harm or suicide
These symptoms last for at least two weeks and interfere with your ability to function.

⚠️ Types of Depression:
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Intense symptoms that interfere with daily life
Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia): Long-term, less severe form lasting 2+ years
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Depression related to seasonal changes (often winter)
Postpartum Depression: Occurs after childbirth
Bipolar Depression: Depressive episodes within bipolar disorder
🛠️ Ways to Manage Depression:
1. Reach Out for Support:
Talk to someone you trust — a friend, family member, counselor, or therapist. You don’t need to go through it alone.

2. Professional Help:

Therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), or other talk therapies can help.
Medication: Antidepressants may be prescribed by a doctor. They take time but can be life-changing.
3. Set Small, Achievable Goals:
Even simple tasks like getting out of bed or taking a shower are wins when you're struggling.

4. Stay Connected:
Isolation worsens depression. Send a message to a friend, join a support group, or spend time in safe, familiar environments.

5. Take Care of Your Body:

Eat nutritious meals
Move your body gently (walk, stretch, etc.)
Stick to a regular sleep schedule
6. Be Kind to Yourself:
Depression lies. It tells you you're not good enough or that you’ll always feel this way. Neither is true.

🚨 When to Seek Immediate Help:
If you're thinking about harming yourself or feel like you can’t go on, please talk to someone immediately.
