Grief is a natural emotional response to losing someone or something important. Itâ€™s not just about death â€” grief can follow the loss of a relationship, job, home, or any major life change.

Common emotions during grief:

Sadness, anger, guilt, or numbness
Confusion or disbelief
Physical symptoms like fatigue or tightness in the chest
Grieving isnâ€™t linear â€” it doesnâ€™t follow a straight path. People may go through stages like:

Denial
Anger
Bargaining
Depression
Acceptance
These stages donâ€™t always happen in order, and not everyone experiences all of them.

Ways to support yourself during grief:

Talk about it â€” to a friend, family member, or counselor
Express it â€” through writing, art, or rituals
Take care of your body â€” eat, rest, and move, even if you donâ€™t feel like it
Be patient â€” healing takes time, and itâ€™s okay to feel how you feel
Grief is the price of love. You're allowed to mourn and to heal.

Mindfulness is the practice of paying full attention to the present moment â€” without judgment. Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful way to reduce stress and improve mental clarity.

Why mindfulness helps:

Reduces anxiety and overthinking
Improves focus and memory
Increases emotional awareness
Helps you stay grounded in the moment
Simple mindfulness exercises:

Deep breathing:
Focus on your breath â€” in through the nose, out through the mouth. Count each breath. Try this for 2â€“5 minutes.
Body scan:
Close your eyes and bring awareness to each part of your body, from your toes to your head. Notice any tension and let it go.
5-senses grounding:
Identify 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.
Mindful eating:
Eat slowly and notice the texture, flavor, and scent of your food. Stay present with each bite.
Apps to try:

Headspace
Calm
Insight Timer
Mindfulness is a skill. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes.
