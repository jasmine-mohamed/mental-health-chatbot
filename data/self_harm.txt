Self-harm is when a person deliberately injures themselves as a way to cope with difficult emotions, painful memories, or overwhelming situations. It is not a healthy coping mechanism, but for some, it feels like the only way to get relief.

Common forms of self-harm:

Cutting or scratching the skin
Hitting or punching oneself
Burning the skin
Pulling out hair
Picking at wounds to prevent healing
Why people self-harm:

To release emotional pain or tension
To feel something when feeling numb
As a form of self-punishment
To express emotions that are hard to talk about
Healthier alternatives:

Hold an ice cube until it melts
Draw on your skin with a red marker instead of cutting
Rip up paper or scribble aggressively on a page
Journal your thoughts or write unsent letters
Listen to loud music and scream into a pillow
Getting support:

You can talk to a therapist who understands self-harm and can help with safer coping strategies
Open up to someone you trust — you don’t have to go through it alone
Recovery is possible. You are not broken. You are worthy of care and support.
