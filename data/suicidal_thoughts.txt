If you are feeling suicidal, please read this carefully:

You are not alone.
You are not a burden.
You are not weak for feeling this way.
And most importantly — there is help, and there is hope.

💬 What Suicidal Thoughts Can Feel Like:
A deep sense of hopelessness
Feeling like a burden to others
Wanting pain to stop, not necessarily wanting life to end
Emotional numbness or overwhelming sadness
Believing things will never get better
Feeling isolated, misunderstood, or invisible
These feelings can be intense and scary, but they are temporary. Things can and do change — even if it feels impossible right now.

🛠️ What You Can Do Right Now:
1. Tell someone.
This could be a friend, family member, teacher, therapist, or even a helpline. You don’t have to explain everything — just saying “I’m not okay” is a start.

2. Call a helpline.
People are there to listen, not judge. They're trained to help you through this moment.

3. Make your environment safer.
If you’re in danger of acting on these thoughts, remove anything harmful from your space or go to a safe place (like a friend's house or public area).

4. Delay the decision.
Promise yourself to wait 24 hours. Focus only on getting through the next 10 minutes. Sometimes, that's all you need to keep going.

5. Ground yourself.
Breathe slowly. Focus on your surroundings. Use grounding techniques like:

Naming 5 things you can see
Saying your name and one good thing about yourself
Holding something cold or textured in your hand
🧠 Professional Help Can Save Lives:
Therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are trained to help you understand what you're going through and find ways to cope. You deserve support — not because you're broken, but because you're human.

💙 Final Thoughts:
Even if you feel like no one cares — I promise you, someone does.
Even if it feels like you're beyond help — you’re not.
Even if the pain is unbearable — it can pass.

You don’t have to fix everything today.
You just need to stay.
You are more loved, more needed, and more important than you realize.
