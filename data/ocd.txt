Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where people experience unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and feel driven to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions).

Examples of obsessions:

Fear of contamination (germs, dirt)
Fear of harming yourself or others
Needing things to be symmetrical or "just right"
Obsessive doubt (Did I lock the door?)
Examples of compulsions:

Excessive cleaning or handwashing
Repeatedly checking things
Counting or tapping rituals
Reassurance seeking
Key facts:

People with OCD often know their thoughts/behaviors are irrational but feel unable to stop them.
Avoiding triggers can make OCD worse over time.
Treatment options:

CBT with ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) is the most effective therapy
Medication, often SSRIs, can also help reduce symptoms
