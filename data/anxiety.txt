Anxiety is the body‚Äôs natural response to stress or perceived danger. It can help keep you alert and focused in small amounts, but when anxiety becomes overwhelming or constant, it can interfere with your daily life.

üí¨ Common Symptoms of Anxiety:
Racing thoughts or constant worry
Feeling restless, nervous, or ‚Äúon edge‚Äù
Increased heart rate or chest tightness
Shortness of breath or shallow breathing
Difficulty sleeping or relaxing
Trouble concentrating or feeling detached
Sweating, shaking, or stomach discomfort
‚ö†Ô∏è Types of Anxiety Disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Persistent worry about everyday things
Social Anxiety Disorder: Fear of being judged or embarrassed in social settings
Panic Disorder: Sudden, intense fear episodes (panic attacks)
Phobias: Extreme fear of specific objects or situations (e.g., heights, spiders)
Health Anxiety: Constant worry about being sick despite reassurance
üõ†Ô∏è Ways to Manage Anxiety:
1. Breathing Techniques:
Slow breathing helps calm your nervous system. Try the 4-7-8 method:
Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat a few times.

2. Grounding Exercises:
Bring yourself back to the present. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique:

5 things you can see
4 things you can touch
3 things you can hear
2 things you can smell
1 thing you can taste
3. Move Your Body:
Exercise helps release endorphins. A short walk, yoga, or stretching can reduce tension.

4. Limit Stimulants:
Cut back on caffeine and energy drinks. They can worsen anxiety symptoms.

5. Talk About It:
Speaking with a friend, family member, or therapist can relieve built-up tension.

6. Practice Mindfulness:
Focus on the present through meditation, journaling, or simply observing your surroundings.

üß† When to Seek Help:
If your anxiety:

Feels constant or uncontrollable
Interferes with work, school, or relationships
Comes with panic attacks or depressive thoughts
then it‚Äôs important to talk to a mental health professional. Treatment options like therapy and medication are highly effective.
Remember: Anxiety does not define you. With support and the right tools, it can be managed ‚Äî and you can feel calm and in control again. You're not alone.
