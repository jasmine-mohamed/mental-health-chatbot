Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme shifts in mood, energy, and behavior. These mood swings range from emotional highs (mania or hypomania) to lows (depression).

Types of bipolar disorder:

Bipolar I: At least one full manic episode, which may be followed by depression
Bipolar II: Hypomanic episodes (less severe) and major depressive episodes
Cyclothymia: Ongoing mood shifts that are less severe but longer lasting
Symptoms of a manic episode:

Very high energy and reduced need for sleep
Racing thoughts and fast speech
Inflated self-confidence or grandiosity
Impulsive decisions (e.g., spending sprees, risky behaviors)
Symptoms of a depressive episode:

Persistent sadness or hopelessness
Loss of interest in daily activities
Low energy and fatigue
Difficulty focusing or making decisions
Suicidal thoughts or feelings
Treatment options:

Mood stabilizer medications (like lithium)
Therapy (especially CBT and psychoeducation)
Regular sleep and structured routines
Avoiding drugs and alcohol
With proper treatment and support, people with bipolar disorder can live stable, meaningful lives.
